Lets say we have 2 numbers X and Y.

Lets say these 2 numbers are going to work with numbers within the range P and Q, where:

Starting range = P
Ending range = Q
With P and Q (range inclusive) evaluate the following:

Total number of multiples of X
Total number of multiples of Y
Sum of multiples of X
sum of multiples of Y
The difference between the above obtained sum.
Input Format

In the first line, get the number: X
In the second line, get the number: Y
In the third line, obtain the starting range number: P
In the fourth line, obtain the ending range number: Q
Constraints

All numbers are positive in nature.

P is always lesser than Q.

10
Sample Output 0

x-Multiples-Count = 5
y-Multiples-Count = 1
x-Multiples-Sum = 30
y-Multiples-Sum = 7
Difference-in-Sum = 23
Explanation 0

Within 1 and 10:

The multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. So, there are 5 multiples.
So, when you add those multiples 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10, you get 30.
The multiples of 7 is itself. So, the count of multiples is 1 and the sum is 7.
The difference between 7 and 30 is 23.
Sample Input 1

Sample Output 1

x-Multiples-Count = 2
y-Multiples-Count = 2
x-Multiples-Sum = 15
y-Multiples-Sum = 15
Difference-in-Sum = 0
Explanation 1

Within 5 and 10:

The multiples of 3 are 6 and 9. So, there are 2 multiples.
So, when you add those multiples 6 + 9, you get 15.
The multiples of 5 are 5 and 10. So, the count of multiples is 2 and the sum is 5 + 10 = 15.
The difference between 15 and 15 is 0.
